#Travel in Korea search engine PBL (project based learning) project assignment: 
Using data from Korea's open data porta (data.gov.kr), class group members and I created a search for travel in Korea's Gangwon-do province. Data was collected using the date portal's API and contained information on attractions, hotels, resorts, restaurants, festivals and stations. The serach was created using the text from each listing and applying TFIDF similarity with the search query.
